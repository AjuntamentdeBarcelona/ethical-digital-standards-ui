    "landingIntroP2": "A decided change that puts the general public at the centre of designing &ldquo;digital by default&rdquo; government services focused on technological sovereignty, free software and open code, and the ethical use of data, in order to be more open and transparent. Using agile methodologies and open technologies in order to be more effective. And transforming public contracting in order to promote innovation in the local talent industry, strengthening the country's small and medium-sized companies. A change that eventually leads to a more open, simple and enriching relationship with the general public as a whole.",
