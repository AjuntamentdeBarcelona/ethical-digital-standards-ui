    <h2 class="landing-intro__title">What is Ethical Digital Standards?</h2>
    <p>Open-digitalisation programme: free software and agile implementation of Barcelona City Council services that
      defines the process of profound, progressive change in the way the city will offer its services to the general
      public in coming years.</p>
    <p>A decided change that puts the general public at the centre of designing "digital by default" government
      services focused on technological sovereignty, free software and open code, and the ethical use of data, in order
      to be more open and transparent. Using agile methodologies and open technologies in order to be more effective.
      And transforming public contracting in order to promote innovation in the local talent industry, strengthening
      the country's small and medium-sized companies. A change that eventually leads to a more open, simple and
      enriching relationship with the general public as a whole.</p>
